# data-diff-hex

This is a little Hex app that puts [open source data-diff](https://docs.datafold.com/os_diff/about) in a visual UI so you don't have to touch the command line!

by [Datafold](https://www.datafold.com/) + [Hex](https://hex.tech/)

Get in touch with Datafold to diff all the tables modified in your PRs as well as downstream data, as part of your CI/CD pipeline, so you'll never break production data again.

This is a demo app run by Leo, not an official Datafold thing. Feel free to make your own version, or ping me if you have questions. üôè
