# data-diff-open-source-projects

### data-diff-hex

This is a little app built with [Datafold](https://www.datafold.com/) + [Hex](https://hex.tech/) that puts [open source data-diff](https://docs.datafold.com/os_diff/about) in a visual UI so you don't have to touch the command line!

This is a demo app run by Leo, not an official Datafold thing. Feel free to make your own version, or ping me if you have questions. üôè

### data-diff.py

This is a simple Python file that you can use to run one-off data diffs locally.
